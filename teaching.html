      <h1 id="ResearchInterests">Teaching Summary</h1>
      <br />
      I have had various teaching and instructing roles at undergraduate level
      teaching which allowed me to gain experience in and develop understanding
      of undergraduate teaching. I am able to teach all aspects of physical
      chemistry, in particular, I am able to conduct lectures and tutorials on
      topics such as classical thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, statistical
      mechanics and mathematics for physical chemists. I am also able to teach
      physical organic chemistry. <br />

      I have also experience in conducting computational chemistry practical
      labs on topics such as applications of quantum mechanics, spectroscopy and
      chemical simulations.
      <br />
      <br />
      <h1 id="ResearchInterests">Teaching Philosophy</h1>
      <br />
      I believe in allowing students to see the real life applications of the
      underlying concepts. For example, when introducing the topic of
      statistical mechanics, we can highlight the importance of using
      statistical mechanics to study real-world problems: in computational
      modelling, we typically set up our system containing one molecule, from
      which the energy levels can be computed. However, in a real-world system,
      there are many molecules (on the order of 10<sup>23</sup>) from which
      macroscopic properties emerge. Using statistical mechanics, we are able to
      connect what we model for one molecule to the properties we get from a
      collection of gazillion molecules, thus greatly simplifying the modelling
      of real-world systems.<br />

      Individuals have varied learning needs. As such, I believe that effective
      teaching and learning begins with a conducive and open learning
      environment, where students and teachers can have open communications
      about their unique learning needs and expectations. Secondly, I believe
      that students need to take the initiatives and be in charge for their own
      learning, especially at the university level, where one of our goals is to
      foster life-long learning skills. Lastly, in a rapidly evolving world
      where knowledge gets updated at an unprecedented pace, to achieve the goal
      of self-directed learning, usually required at university level, or even
      much so after graduation, I believe as teachers, we should teach students
      methods for acquiring knowledge. As the Chinese saying that goes
      "授之以鱼不如授之以渔", it is better to teach a man how to fish, rather
      than giving him the fish.
