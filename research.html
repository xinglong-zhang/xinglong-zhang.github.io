      <h2><strong>Research Summary</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
      We are interested in employing electronic structure theory calculations,
      mainly relying on
      <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory"
        >density funnctional theory (DFT)</a
      >, to perform computational mechanistic investigations of complex organic
      and organometallic catalytic systems of both academic and industrial
      significance. We currently focus on transition-metal catalysed C–H
      functionalisation as well as organocatalytic asymmetric synthesis for
      complex molecules constructions. <br />

      We are building up capabililies in applying machine learning interatomic
      potentials (MLIPs) to study traditionally challenging chemical systems
      such as dynamic and entropic effects that are hard to capture accurately
      with static DFT. Our interests also include coding and workflow
      development to facilitate high-throughput quantum chemical studies and
      machine learning applications, with the goal of streamlining computational
      research practices.
      <!-- My future research directions include studying catalytic systems for CO<sub>2</sub> conversion and supramolecular cage catalysts for sustainable syntheses. -->

        <h3>1.1 Organometallic catalysis</h3>
        <h4>C–H functionalisation</h4>
        <p>
          Transition metal (TM) catalysed C–H functionalisations present many
          opportunities for organic synthesis by forging useful C–X bonds from
          unreactive, ubiquitous C–H bonds present in many organic molecules.
          The use of TMs to <i>selectively</i> functionalise C–H bonds is
          particularly attractive as it provides atom economical ways to either
          convert small alkanes to higher valued, functionalised molecules or
          directly manipulating complex molecules with other functional groups
          present. Such TM-catalysed C–H functionalisation usually rely on
          directing groups (DGs) for target C–H activation. Directing group free
          methods have also been developed to sidestep the need for the
          introduction and subsequent removal of covalent DGs for step economy.
          We are interested in studying the mechanisms of such DG-assisted and
          DG-free catalytic systems.

                functionalisation with simultaneous chirality control.

          Due to the multistep nature of these complex mechanisms, an
          understanding of the full catalytic cycle is essential in determining
          the key intermediates and turnover-frequency determining step. By
          exploring the key transition states and intermediates on the potential
          energy surface of the system, we are able to propose catalytic
          mechanism for a given reaction.

        <p>
          In the study of reaction mechanisms, we often need to understand the
          molecular origins giving rise to different chemical selectivities. We
          may also need to compare chemical reactivities of different
          substrates. For example, in the <i>meta</i>-selective C–H
          functionalisation of arenes (top panel), we are able to
          computationally elucidate the origins behind the exclusive
          <i>meta</i>- over <i>para</i>- or <i>ortho</i>-selectivity. We do this
          by comparing the turnover-frequency determining transition states
          (TDTSs) at each site (middle panel). We are able to computationally
          calculate the differences of the ring strain in the different sized
          palladacylce intermediate using isodesmic reaction enthalpy
          calculations to compare the different degrees of ring strain in each
          transition state.
          <figure>
            <a href="images/selectivity.jpeg" target="_blank"
              ><img src="images/selectivity.jpeg" width="850" align="center"

                and the relative barriers for arene site selectivity (middle
                panel) and the ring strains for <i>E</i>-allyl product formation
                over <i>Z</i>-allyl and styrenyl product formations (last
                panel).
              </p></figurecaption
            >
          </figure>

          The formation of final (either allyl or styrenyl) product requires
          &beta;-H elimination. This step requires the requisite H-atom to be
          coordinated to the Pd-metal before it can be eliminated. From the
          dihedral scan for the barriers to bring the target H-atom to interact
          agostically with the Pd-center, we can see that the formation of
          <i>E</i>-allyl product has the lowest such barrier; the rotational
          barrier to bring the H-atom to interact with Pd-center in order to
          form styrenyl product is way larger than forming allyl products (note
          the different energy scales).

        <h4>C–C bond formation</h4>
        <p>
          The ability to form C–C bonds is central to the synthesis of a wide
          range of organic compounds, including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals
          and natural products, allowing chemists to construct complex molecules
          from simpler starting materials. Achieving control over where the bond
          forms on a molecule (regioselectivity) is crucial, especially for
          molecules with multiple reactivity sites. Coupled with these
          challenges, desirable catalysts need to be cheap and sustainable. In
          collaboration with experimentalists, we focus on the mechanistic
          elucidation of Fe-catalysed conjunctive cross-coupling reactions
          (Figure Top), which brings multiple components together to form
          complex molecules under Fe catalysis. Due to the variable spin states
          of Fe (high spin vs low spin) and the potential involvement of Fe in
          different oxidation states (Fe(I), Fe(II), Fe(III)), using only
          experimental techniques may not be sufficient to fully understand the
          catalytic cycle. We employ DFT calculations to understand the
          mechanism of such complex transformations (Figure Bottom).

        <h3>1.2 Organocatalysis and asymmetric catalysis</h3>
        <h4>N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis</h4>

        <p>
          NHC organocatalysts offer diverse catalytic activation modes:
          NHC-activated species can react with either electrophile at carbonyl
          carbon via umpolung addition or with nucleophile via oxidised Brewslow
          intermediate. This provides many avenues for computational tools to
          study the detailed mechanisms. Our lab will study metal-free
          organocatalysis including carbene catalysis. We aim to contribute to
          the field of organocatalysis for chiral molecules construction with
          the aim of discovering novel activation modes and functionalising
          challenging inert molecules such as carbonyl compounds, ketenes and
          alcohols for applications in pharmaceutical, agrochemical and
          specialty chemicals syntheses. Some challenges in the field such as
          using NHCs as asymmetric Brønsted bases will be explored.

          Chiral NHC carbenes have been employed as organocatalysts to effect
          stereo- and enantioinduction via acyl azolium intermediates, which, due
          to the chirality imparted by the chiral carbene, may be attacked
          selectively by nucleophile from either the <i>Re</i>- or the
          <i>Si</i>-face of the carbonyl group (e.g., attack by hydroxyl group of monosaccharides). </p>

            The chiral carbene catalysts may also be involved in the formation of chiral intermediates with biased sterics and electronics, which allows it to enantioselectively attack one face of a prochiral substrate rather than another. For example, in the reaction below, chiral carbene forms aza-Breslow intermediate which can be oxidized to triaza-diene intermediate that attacks the <i>Si</i>-face, instead of the <i>Re</i>-face, of of the isatin substrate.</p>

          <p>For accurate prediction of the selectivity step, we need to perform detailed conformational sampling (and Boltzmann weighting of all TS conformers of competing pathways, if the conformers are very close in energy), as the wrong use of conformers may lead to wrong predictions as shown in the figure below. We usually perform CREST conformational sampling on located TS structures with constraints on key reacting bonds and, depending on the size of the system, use 5-20 lowest xTB energy structures for further TS optimisation under DFT refinement. </p>

          We are also able to computationally model chemical reactions within a
          biological environment. In one project, we applied DFT studies to
          understand the labelling of &alpha;-C of amino acid residues, which
          can be useful as potential probes for investigating chemical
          structures and mechanisms. This is especially important if intact
          small peptides and proteins can be labelled <i>in situ</i>.
          Dehydroalanine (Dha) amino acid residue, formed from postsynthetic
          modifications and normal metabolism, can serve as a target for
          deteuration at its &alpha;-C. The mechanism for the formation of
          dehydroalanine from dialkylated cysteine residue can be investigated
          using quantum mechanical tools such as DFT. The competing mechanisms
          of E2 elimination vs deprotonation forming a sulfonium ylide followed
          by intramolecular ‘carba-Swern’ type cycloreversion can be directly
          compared.

          Traditional DFT studies in catalytic systems often rely on static DFT
          with implicit solvation models1. While this approach provides
          explanatory and predictive successes at reduced computational costs,
          it may fall short when solvent molecules actively participate in the
          reaction and explicit solvation is required. However, studying
          catalytic systems with explicit solvation at the DFT level can be
          computationally prohibitive, especially for large dynamical systems
          where numerous trajectories are needed.

          Building upon our work on MLIPs for reactive chemistry in heterogenous
          catalysis, we are currently exploring how to apply such MLIPs for
          studying homogenous catalytic systems where explicit solvents and
          large entropic changes play important roles. We hope to leverage
          active learning to reduce training costs without worrying about the
          transferability of the MLIP potential. With these tools, the study of
          costly and challenging systems, such as explicit solvation and
          dynamical effects on a large length- and time-scale, can be routinely
          carried out at DFT-level accuracy within affordable costs.
